# Newtonian Solar System Physics Simulator

 - Orbits start the simulation at perihelion with velocity and radius data taken from NASA.
 - The sun is not stationary, it can wobble due to the pull of the planets.
 - The time scale can be changed to your liking in constants.py (see TIMESTEP constant).
 - You can add objects as you like, just have a look at how the planets were added.
 - Newtonian Gravitation. This means Mercury's orbit is innaccurate due to the relativistic
   effects that the real planet feels not being part of the program.
 - Based on the Tech with Tim tutorial.
